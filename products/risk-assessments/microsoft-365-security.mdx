## Requirements

To get login and security data from M365, a Microsoft Entra ID P1 (NCE) license and Global admin is required. This license allows us to retrieve monitor login statistics like location and MFA status from Microsoft. This license comes with audit logging which enables us to monitor M365 security. Check out plans, cost, and features [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/microsoft-entra-pricing).

## Configuration

To configure the M365 security, go to your Risk Assessment > Configuration > Configure Microsoft 365 and follow the steps to connect your M365 admin account. Make sure you have the required licenses as described in the previous sections.
