---

Telivy's AI scoring system provides an advanced layer of security assessment by leveraging machine learning algorithms to analyze patterns, predict potential vulnerabilities, and offer actionable security insights.

## Introduction

<Note>
  AI scoring complements traditional security assessments by providing predictive analysis and dynamic risk evaluation that adapts to emerging threats.
</Note>

The AI scoring system processes vast amounts of security data to:
- Identify subtle patterns that might indicate security risks
- Predict potential future vulnerabilities
- Provide contextual risk assessment based on your organization's specific profile
- Automate security posture evaluation

## Methodology

The AI scoring system uses a multi-layered approach to evaluate security risks:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Data Collection" icon="database">
    Continuously gathers data from multiple sources:
    - Network traffic patterns
    - User behavior analytics
    - System configurations
    - External threat intelligence feeds
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Pattern Analysis" icon="chart-line">
    Applies machine learning algorithms to:
    - Detect anomalies in system behavior
    - Identify potential attack vectors
    - Evaluate security control effectiveness
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Risk Calculation" icon="calculator">
    Combines multiple factors to generate risk scores:
    - Historical security incidents
    - Current threat landscape
    - Industry-specific risk factors
    - Organizational security maturity
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Scoring Components

The AI scoring system evaluates security across multiple dimensions:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Threat Intelligence" icon="radar">
    Analyzes current and emerging threats specific to your industry and technology stack
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Behavioral Analysis" icon="user-gear">
    Evaluates user and system behavior patterns to identify potential security risks
  </Card>

  <Card title="Configuration Assessment" icon="sliders">
    Reviews system configurations against security best practices
  </Card>

  <Card title="Vulnerability Correlation" icon="shield-halved">
    Correlates identified vulnerabilities with real-world exploit potential
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Scoring Scale

The AI generates scores on a scale of 1-100, which are then mapped to risk levels:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Critical Risk (80-100)">
    Immediate attention required. High likelihood of security breach if not addressed.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="High Risk (60-79)">
    Significant vulnerabilities present. Should be addressed in the short term.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Medium Risk (40-59)">
    Moderate security concerns that should be planned for remediation.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Low Risk (0-39)">
    Minor security concerns or well-secured areas.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

    - Set up alerts for significant score changes
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Score Investigation" icon="magnifying-glass">
    - Analyze contributing factors to high-risk scores
    - Review AI-generated recommendations
    - Correlate scores with security events
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Response Planning" icon="clipboard-check">
    - Develop response procedures for different score ranges
    - Prioritize remediation based on AI risk assessment
    - Document effectiveness of remediation actions
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Acting on AI Scores

<Info>
  AI scores should be used as part of a comprehensive security strategy, not as the sole decision-making factor.
</Info>

When acting on AI scores, consider:

1. **Prioritization**: Focus on highest-risk areas identified by AI scoring
2. **Validation**: Verify AI findings through security testing and expert review
3. **Remediation**: Implement recommended security improvements
4. **Monitoring**: Track score changes after implementing security measures

<Warning>
  While AI scoring provides valuable insights, it should be combined with human expertise and traditional security assessments for optimal results.
