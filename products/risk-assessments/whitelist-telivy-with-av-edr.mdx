## Whitelist Telivy

### How to get your Anti-Virus to allow smooth installation of Telivy

To whitelist your Anti-Virus or EDR, follow these instructions:

1. If installation is failing:
   1. First, whitelist the domain [install.telivy.com](http://install.telivy.com)
   2. Then, if still not working, whitelist directory: “C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Telivy”
2. If installation succeeds, but Telivy cannot connect to our services:
   1. Domains:
      1. [agent-v1.telivy.com](http://agent-v1.telivy.com)
      2. [install.telivy.com](http://install.telivy.com)
   2. Executables:
      1. C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Telivy\\Telivy Agent\\TelivyAgent.exe
      2. C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Telivy\\Telivy Agent\\TelivyScanner.exe
      3. C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Telivy\\Telivy Agent\\telivy_pdf_text.exe
   3. If neither of the above work, we then advise more excessive whitelisting:
      1. Domains: \*.[telivy.com](http://telivy.com)
      2. Folders: "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Telivy\\Telivy Agent"

## Installation Timeline

Once the installation has been kicked off, here are the sequence of events to be performed:

1. When using RMM installation, the first step is to download the MSI from [install.telivy.com](http://install.telivy.com) and install the package. If you notice that the download has failed, please check your Anti-Virus status (instructions seen above).
2. Our installation process is as follows:
   1. Extracting the necessary executables to the installation folder
   2. Setting registry entries
   3. Creating and starting a Windows Service
3. Telivy Agent is a Windows Service that sends a heartbeat log and starts Telivy Scanner every hour.
4. The first step for the Telivy Scanner is to reach the Telivy servers to create an asset in your assessment. It gathers a hostname, OS name, and any other machine-identifying metadata.
5. The asset scan is then triggered, which includes vulnerability scanning, application scanning, PII scans, and password analysis.
6. The status then changes to “In Progress” in the Telivy portal.
7. The controller checks in every 1 hour to check if the scan has completed. Usually, the PII scan takes a bit depending on how many files are present on the asset.

## Under the Hood

### What happens under the hood

Some of the executables that we run are as follows:

1. **C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Telivy\\Telivy Agent\\TelivyAgent.exe:** Registers as Windows Service, a controller orchestrating the scanning process. Responsible for periodically running Telivy Scanner and sending heartbeat log to Telivy services.
2. **C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Telivy\\Telivy Agent\\telivy_pdf_text.exe:** Used to parse texts in PDFs.
3. **C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Telivy\\Telivy Agent\\TelivyScanner.exe:** Performs the actual scanning.
