description: 'Understanding Your Telivy Internal Security Scan Report'
---

This article aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the Telivy Internal Security Scan report. The Telivy report offers a detailed assessment of your organization's security posture and highlighting potential vulnerabilities.

Each security section is divided into 1 or more sub sections. Each subsection has a grade and a weight for the final section grade. The final grade will then be determined as follows:

```Final Score = Sum(Section Weight X Section Score)/Sum(Section Weight)```

Section score is on a scale from 1 to 4 with 1 being most secure and 4 being least secure. Once the final score is determined, the conversion to a grade score is calculated as follows:

Final Score Range | Grade
--- | ---
4 | F
3 - 4 | D
2 - 3 | C
1 - 2 | B

## Network Security

Network security consists of the following subsections:

1. Internal Vulnerabilities
2. External Vulnerabilities
3. Open Ports
4. Certificate Security
5. HTTPs security

#### Internal Vulnerability

Internal Vulnerability grades will be determined as follows:

Criteria | Grade
--- | ---
\>10% of users have a atleast 1 critical Vulnerability | 4

#### External Vulnerability

External Vulnerability grades will be determined as follows:

Criteria | Grade
--- | ---
Any High Severity findings | 4
Any Medium Severity findings | 3
Only Low Severity findings | 2
No findings | 1

#### Open Ports

Open Ports grades will be determined as follows:

Criteria | Grade
--- | ---
Any High Severity open ports | 4
Any Medium Severity open ports | 3
Only Low Severity open ports | 2
No open ports | 1

#### Certificates

Certificate grades will be determined as follows:

Criteria | Grade
--- | ---
Any High Severity certificate findings | 4
Any Medium Severity certificate findings | 3
Only Low Severity certificate findings | 2
No certificate findings | 1

#### HTTPs findings

HTTPs grades will be determined as follows:

Criteria | Grade
--- | ---
HTTPs not enabled | 3
HTTPs enabled | 1

### Weights for Network Security

Internal Vulnerabilities: 10
External Vulnerabilities: 8
Port Scans: 6
Certificate: 4
HTTPs: 8

## Data Security

Data Security grades will be determined as follows:

Criteria | Grade
--- | ---
At Least 1 user with data value >= $100,000 (OR) Total risk >= $1,000,000 | D
Total risk >$100,000 and less than $1,000,000 | C
Total risk >$10,000 and less than $100,000 | B
Total risk \<$10,000 | A

## Dark Web Security

Dark Web grades will be determined as follows:

Criteria | Grade
--- | ---
Dark Web findings in the last 2 year | D
Dark Web findings only prior to last 2 years but newer than 5 years | C
Dark Web findings prior to 5 years | B
No Dark Web findings | A

## Password Security

Password grade security will be determined as follows:

Criteria | Grade
--- | ---
High number of weak and compromised passwords found | D
Weak and compromised passwords found | C
Few weak or compromised passwords found | B
