## Uninstallation

### How to uninstall Telivy on your Windows Asset

Uninstallation removes the Telivy scanner on the device but the *data gathered during the latest scan still remains on the portal* and is part of the Risk Assessment dashboard and any report generated.

You can uninstall directly from the dashboard using the **Uninstall** button for *each asset* or you can *uninstall all the devices* at once by clicking on the **Uninstall All** button.
