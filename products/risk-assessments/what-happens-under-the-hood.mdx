Telivy uses executables to complete the different types of scans. In this section, we will list all the locations and the names of the executables to provide more context to help you with anti-virus whitelisting.

Some of the executables that we run are as follows:

1. **C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Telivy\\Telivy Agent\\TelivyAgent.exe:** Registers as Windows Service, a controller orchestrating the scanning process. Responsible for periodically running Telivy Scanner and sending heartbeat log to Telivy services.
2. **C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Telivy\\Telivy Agent\\telivy_pdf_text.exe:** Used to parse texts in PDFs.
3. **C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Telivy\\Telivy Agent\\TelivyScanner.exe:** Performs the actual scanning.
