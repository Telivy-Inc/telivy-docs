Telivy uses executables for completing the different types of scans. In this section we will list all the locations and the name of the executables to provide more context to help you with anti virus whitelisting.

Some of the executables that we run are as follows:
1. **C:\Program Files (x86)\Telivy\Telivy Agent\TelivyAgent.exe**: Installs and runs as a Windows Service. Used to perform the network, application and PII scan on the device.
