## Create a Button on page

Create a Button component that matches rest of the website using your website builder (Ex. Wix, Wordpress, Webflow). If the link will be embedded on an email or marketing flyers, skip this step. 

## Redirect with Link 

Use a unique, ready to use link to redirect webpage button, email etc. without any coding or development needed.

Your link can be accessed under **Account >> Lead Magnet**. It should resemble the below format:

```https://portal.telivy.com/start/{unique-account-id}```
