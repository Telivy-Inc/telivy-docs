**You'll know it worked when:**

- The Autotask integration shows as enabled in Telivy with a checkmark or active status
- You can successfully map Telivy clients to Autotask accounts
- Tasks from Telivy assessments appear as tickets in your Autotask queue
- Task status changes in Telivy update the corresponding tickets in Autotask
- The integration configuration is saved and persists across sessions

---

## Common Tasks

### Viewing Synchronized Tickets

- Navigate to Autotask PSA → Service Desk to view tickets created from Telivy tasks
- Tickets will appear in the queue and priority you configured during setup

### Manually Syncing Tasks

- Open any task in Telivy and click **Sync Now** to immediately create or update the corresponding Autotask ticket
- Use this for urgent issues that need immediate ticket creation

### Updating Status Mappings

- Return to Account → Integrations → Autotask to modify status mappings if your Autotask workflow changes
- Changes take effect for new synchronizations

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Integration connection fails with authentication error

**Solution:**

- Verify the API Key and Secret were copied correctly from Autotask (no extra spaces)
- Ensure the API user in Autotask has the correct security level with Web Services API access enabled
- Check that the API user account is active in Autotask

### Issue: Tasks are not creating tickets in Autotask

**Solution:**

- Verify the company/assessment is mapped to an Autotask account (Step 5)
- Check that the default queue, priority, and status settings are valid in your Autotask instance
- Ensure the API user has permissions to create tickets in the selected queue
- Try manually syncing a task using the "Sync Now" button to test the connection

### Issue: Status mappings are not updating tickets correctly

**Solution:**

- Review your Autotask workflow to ensure the mapped statuses (New, In Progress, Complete) exist
- Update the status mappings in Telivy integration settings to match your Autotask workflow
- Verify the API user has edit permissions for tickets

---

## Additional Information

- **Webhook Requirements:** The integration requires permission to create webhooks in Autotask. This is included in the security level configuration in Step 2.
- **Status Synchronization:** Task status changes in Telivy will update the corresponding Autotask ticket status based on your configured mappings.
- **Auto-Assignment:** Tickets will automatically assign status based on issue severity status in addition to your default status setting.
- **Status Mappings:** You can map both Resolved and Complete task statuses to different Autotask statuses to match your workflow.
- **Multiple Assessments:** Each client assessment can be mapped to a different Autotask account if needed.
- **Manual Sync:** Use the "Sync Now" button for immediate synchronization; otherwise, tasks sync automatically based on status changes.
