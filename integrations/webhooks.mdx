  <Accordion title="Introduction">
     Webhooks provide a way for your systems to receive real-time notifications when specific events occur in Telivy. When an event happens, we'll send an HTTP POST request to the URL you specified when setting up the webhook.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Webhook Events">
    When archiving an assessment, you will receive the following notification:

    Currently, Telivy supports the following webhook events:

    - ASSESSMENT_STATUS_CHANGED: Triggered when an assessment's status changes
    - ALERT_RAISED: Triggered when an alert is raised for your agency
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Setting Up Webhooks">
    Webhooks are set up through your Telivy dashboard. For each webhook, you'll need to specify:

    1. A destination URL that will receive the webhook requests
    2. The events you want to subscribe to
    3. Whether you want the payload to be encrypted
    4. Any additional HTTP headers you want us to include in the request

    When you create a webhook subscription, we'll generate a secret key that you'll use to verify the authenticity of webhook requests and decrypt encrypted payloads.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Processing Webhooks">
    ### **Best Practices**

    When processing webhooks, we recommend the following approach:

    1. **Receive the webhook data**
    2. **Verify the signature** to ensure the request is from Telivy
    3. **Return a 2xx response** immediately (preferably a 200 OK)
    4. **Process the webhook data asynchronously** after returning the response

    This approach ensures that your webhook endpoint responds quickly, preventing timeouts and unnecessary retries from our system. Our webhook requests will time out after 10 seconds.

    ### **HTTP Response Codes**

    - **2xx**: Success - We'll consider the webhook delivered
    - **Other status codes**: Failure - We will retry sending the webhook, first time right after, second time with a delay
