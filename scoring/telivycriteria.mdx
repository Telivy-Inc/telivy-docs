This article aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the Telivy Internal Security Scan report. The Telivy report offers a detailed assessment of your organization's security posture and highlights potential vulnerabilities.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Final Score">
    Each security section is divided into 1 or more sub sections. Each subsection has a grade and a weight for the final section grade. The final grade will then be determined as follows:

    `Final Score = Sum(Section Weight X Section Score)/Sum(Section Weight)`

    Section score is on a scale from 1 to 4 with 1 being most secure and 4 being least secure. Once the final score is determined, the conversion to a grade score is calculated as follows:

    | Final Score Range | Grade |
    | ----------------- | ----- |
    | 4                 | F     |
    | 3 - 4             | D     |
    | 2 - 3             | C     |
    | 1 - 2             | B     |

    Network security consists of the following subsections:

    1. Internal Vulnerabilities

    2. External Vulnerabilities

    3. Open Ports

    4. Certificate Security

    5. HTTPs security
