title: Multi-Factor Authentication
description: 'Make Your Account More Secure'

Traditional logins rely solely on passwords, which are vulnerable to hacking through data breaches, phishing scams, or even plain old forgetting. Multi Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security, making it significantly harder for unauthorized access. Even strong passwords can be compromised. With MFA, even if someone steals your password, they'll still need that second authentication factor, like a code from your phone to gain access. This significantly reduces the risk of account takeovers.

Knowing your Telivy account is protected by MFA gives you peace of mind. You can confidently store sensitive information like payment details or client data on the platform without worrying about unauthorized access. Telivy enables MFA by default for your account.

## Registering for MFA

<Steps>
  <Step title="Steps To Register For MFA">
    On your first login, you will be prompted to register using an authentication app like Google Authenticator. This can be done either by scanning the QR code or entering the seed phrase.

    If you are unable to scan using your authenticator app, click on "Trouble Scanning?" to see the seed phrase. Then enter this seed phrase in your authenticator app.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter One-Time Code">
    Once you scan the QR code (or enter the code manually), then you will be prompted to enter the one time code generated by your authenticator app.

  <Step title='Click "Continue"'>
    Click on Continue. In the following screen you will be prompted to save a "Recovery Code". A recovery code can be used to log into your Telivy account if you do not have access to your authenticator app or your device. Make sure you keep this recovery code safe.

  <Step title="Confirm Receipt Of Code">
    After you save this code, click on the checkbox for "I have safely recorded this code". This should complete the MFA registration.

## Logging Into With Your Telivy Portal

Whenever you login to your Telivy portal, you might be prompted to enter your MFA code.

Enter your one time code from the authenticator app. If you trust your current device, you can choose to remember the device for 30 days, during which you will not be prompted for MFA.

If you do not have access to your authenticator app, choose "Try another method" and you will be prompted to enter your recovery code to login.
