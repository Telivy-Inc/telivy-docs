  <Accordion title="How Do I Start The Installation Process For A Risk Assessment?">
    Please refer to [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1udauxMxkkn6lN3fTyg-eZ24DCKj2gc9PAqqZtOx4taI/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.cqf0wabvjxiy) article for more details on the installation process.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What Software(s) Do You Install For The Risk Assessment?">
    The list of softwares installed are detailed in [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1udauxMxkkn6lN3fTyg-eZ24DCKj2gc9PAqqZtOx4taI/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.mtnu2ko2007j) section.

  <Accordion title="On What Devices Should I Install Telivy?">
    The Telivy agent can be installed on supported servers, laptops, and desktops. For optimal coverage, we recommend installing it on as close to 100% of your client devices as possible. However, if this is not feasible, we recommend installing it on a diverse set of devices. For example, you could install it on one device from each department, such as HR, accounting, and sales. This will help you to capture trends across your organization.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How Do I Verify That Telivy Has Successfully Run On A Device?">
    When you run Telivy on a device, it should show up on the Assets page with details on the installation.

    If you do not see the device in the assets page it could mean two things:

    1. There is an Anti Virus, Firewall or similar software that is blocking the execution.

    2. The devices are added to the wrong Risk Assessment. You should be able to uninstall from the wrong risk assessment and add it back to the correct one.

    If you want to verify installation without accessing the assets page, you can check for whether "Telivy" shows up in the list of installed software in Control Panel.

  <Accordion title="Why Is My Asset Scan/Rescan Taking A Long Time?">
    A scan or a rescan can complete only when the system is up for a sufficient amount of time - typically 2 hours continuously. If you still see the rescan to be in progress after being online for a long time, please reach out to support@telivy.com and we can take look at the reason for the delay.
