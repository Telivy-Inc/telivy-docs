  <Accordion title="How To I Reset MFA?">
    If you have lost your MFA recovery code or the seed phrase, please send us an email to support@telivy.com and we can reset the MFA for you. Please make sure you are using the same email as the one registered with Telivy for security purposes.

    We might end asking you a few security questions based on your account settings. For more details on registering for MFA, please refer to [this](/getting-started/set-up-telivy-account/multi-factor-authentication.mdx) article.
